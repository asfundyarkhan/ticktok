# Product Image and Navigation Updates - COMPLETED

## Issue 1: Missing Product Images on Stock/Pending Page

Product images were not displaying correctly on the stock/pending page, showing placeholders (`/images/placeholders/product.svg`) instead of actual Firebase product images.

### Solution Implemented:

1. **Enhanced Product Image Retrieval Logic**:

   - Updated `sellerWalletService.ts` to use multiple strategies to find product images:
     - Added checks for the `image` field (standard in Product type)
     - Added fallback to `mainImage` field
     - Added fallback to first entry in `images` array
     - Added additional fallback to any field containing "image" in its name
     - Added fallback to any product image stored directly in deposit data

2. **URL Formatting for Firebase Storage**:

   - Fixed URL conversion for Firebase Storage paths:

   ```typescript
   // Make sure the image URL is a full URL
   if (
     productImage &&
     !productImage.startsWith("http") &&
     !productImage.startsWith("data:")
   ) {
     // Convert relative paths to absolute Firebase Storage URLs
     if (!productImage.includes("/")) {
       // It's likely just a filename - construct a path in the products folder
       productImage = `https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/ticktokshop-5f1e9.appspot.com/o/products%2F${encodeURIComponent(
         productImage
       )}?alt=media`;
     } else if (productImage.startsWith("/")) {
       // Remove the leading slash before encoding
       const path = productImage.substring(1);
       productImage = `https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/ticktokshop-5f1e9.appspot.com/o/${encodeURIComponent(
         path
       )}?alt=media`;
     } else {
       productImage = `https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/ticktokshop-5f1e9.appspot.com/o/${encodeURIComponent(
         productImage
       )}?alt=media`;
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Improved Next.js Image Component Handling**:

   - Updated `stock/pending/page.tsx` to properly validate image URLs:

   ```tsx
   <Image
     src={
       product.productImage && product.productImage.startsWith("http")
         ? product.productImage
         : "/images/placeholders/product.svg"
     }
     alt={product.productName}
     width={64}
     height={64}
     className="object-cover w-full h-full"
     onError={(e) => {
       console.log("Image failed to load:", e.currentTarget.src);
       e.currentTarget.src = "/images/placeholders/product.svg";
     }}
     unoptimized={true}
     priority
   />
   ```

4. **Improved Error Handling and Logging**:
   - Added detailed console logging to track which source provided the image
   - Added comprehensive error handling to prevent failures when images are missing

## Issue 2: Unnecessary Inventory Tab in Navigation

The inventory page is no longer needed in the seller navigation but was still showing up in multiple places.

### Solution Implemented:

1. **Removed Inventory Tab from Multiple Pages**:

   - Removed from `/stock/pending` page navigation
   - Removed from `/stock/listings` page navigation
   - Removed from main `/stock` page navigation

2. **Simplified Navigation Experience**:
   - Navigation now consistently shows only: General, Receipts, Product Pool, My Listings, and Orders

## Results

### Image Display Improvements:

- Product images now display correctly on the stock/pending page for both desktop and mobile views
- Fixed Firebase Storage URL formatting ensures images load properly from cloud storage
- Enhanced fallback system provides placeholders only when absolutely needed
- Comprehensive logging helps track image loading issues if they occur

### Navigation Improvements:

- Navigation is consistent across all stock-related pages
- Unnecessary inventory tab removed from all navigation areas
- Cleaner, more intuitive navigation experience for sellers

### Testing Verification:

- ✅ Desktop view: Images display correctly
- ✅ Mobile view: Images display correctly
- ✅ Error handling: Fallbacks to placeholders when needed
- ✅ Navigation consistency across all stock pages

## Additional Accomplishments:

- Maintained data consistency between stock/pending page and profile page
- Ensured USDT-only payment options across relevant pages
- Improved code organization with clear error handling and logging
- Enhanced the overall user experience with visual consistency

## Date: July 1, 2025 - Implementation Completed
