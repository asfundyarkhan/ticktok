# Store Page Withdrawal Button Implementation

## Feature Added
Added a withdrawal button with full functionality to the store/product pool page, allowing sellers to request withdrawals directly from the main shopping interface.

## Implementation Details

### New Features Added

#### 1. **Wallet Balance Display**
- Shows current available balance in real-time
- Displays pending amounts if any
- Only visible to logged-in users
- Updates automatically when balance changes

#### 2. **Withdrawal Button**
- Located in the top-right header next to the cart icon
- Only shows for logged-in users with available balance ≥ $5
- Clean design with money icon
- Opens withdrawal modal when clicked

#### 3. **Full Withdrawal Functionality**
- Uses the existing `WithdrawalModal` component
- Connects to the withdrawal request system
- Real-time balance validation
- Proper error handling and success notifications

### UI Design

#### Header Layout
```
[Shop Title] [Search Bar] [Wallet: $121.05] [Withdraw Button] [Cart Icon]
```

#### Conditional Display Logic
- **Wallet Display**: Shows for all logged-in users
- **Withdraw Button**: Only shows if user has ≥ $5.00 available balance
- **Guest Users**: See neither wallet nor withdraw button

### Code Implementation

#### Added Imports
```typescript
import WithdrawalModal from "@/app/components/WithdrawalModal";
import { useAuth } from "@/context/AuthContext";
import { SellerWalletService } from "@/services/sellerWalletService";
import type { WalletBalance } from "@/types/wallet";
```

#### State Management
```typescript
// Withdrawal functionality state
const [showWithdrawalModal, setShowWithdrawalModal] = useState(false);
const [walletBalance, setWalletBalance] = useState<WalletBalance>({
  available: 0,
  pending: 0,
  total: 0,
});
const [sellerName, setSellerName] = useState("");
const [sellerEmail, setSellerEmail] = useState("");
```

#### Real-time Balance Subscription
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (user?.uid) {
    // Subscribe to wallet balance changes
    const unsubscribe = SellerWalletService.subscribeToWalletBalance(
      user.uid,
      setWalletBalance
    );

    // Load seller profile for withdrawal modal
    const loadSellerProfile = async () => {
      const { UserService } = await import("@/services/userService");
      const profile = await UserService.getUserProfile(user.uid);
      if (profile) {
        setSellerName(profile.displayName || profile.email?.split("@")[0] || "Unknown Seller");
        setSellerEmail(profile.email || "");
      }
    };

    loadSellerProfile();
    return unsubscribe;
  }
}, [user?.uid]);
```

#### UI Components
```typescript
{/* Wallet Balance Display */}
{user && (
  <div className="text-sm text-gray-600">
    <span className="font-medium">Wallet: </span>
    <span className="text-green-600 font-semibold">
      ${walletBalance.available.toFixed(2)}
    </span>
    {walletBalance.pending > 0 && (
      <span className="text-orange-600 ml-1">
        (+${walletBalance.pending.toFixed(2)} pending)
      </span>
    )}
  </div>
)}

{/* Withdrawal Button */}
{user && walletBalance.available >= 5 && (
  <button
    onClick={() => setShowWithdrawalModal(true)}
    className="flex items-center gap-2 bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded-lg text-sm font-medium transition-colors"
  >
    <svg className="w-4 h-4" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
      <path strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" strokeWidth={2} d="M12 8c-1.657 0-3 .895-3 2s1.343 2 3 2 3 .895 3 2-1.343 2-3 2m0-8c1.11 0 2.08.402 2.599 1M12 8V7m0 1v8m0 0v1m0-1c-1.11 0-2.08-.402-2.599-1" />
    </svg>
    Withdraw
  </button>
)}

{/* Withdrawal Modal */}
<WithdrawalModal
  isOpen={showWithdrawalModal}
  onClose={() => setShowWithdrawalModal(false)}
  availableBalance={walletBalance.available}
  sellerName={sellerName}
  sellerEmail={sellerEmail}
/>
```
