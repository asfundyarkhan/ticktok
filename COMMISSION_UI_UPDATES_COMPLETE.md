**Changes Made**:

- ✅ Changed title from "My Commission Balance" to "My Revenue Overview"
- ✅ Updated main label from "Total Commission Earned" to "My Merchant Deposits"
- ✅ Changed description from "From deposits only, not product sales" to "From deposits and receipt approvals only"
- ✅ Removed the "Total Transactions" section (transaction history section)

### 2. Renamed Commission History to Transaction History

**File**: `src/app/components/CommissionHistory.tsx`

**Changes Made**:

### 3. Updated Commission Dashboard Page

**File**: `src/app/dashboard/commission/page.tsx`
