# Zero Quantity Stock Deletion

## Overview
This document explains the implementation of automatic deletion of stock items that reach zero quantity in the TikTok Shop application.

## Problem Statement
When stock items reach zero quantity, they need to be deleted from stock listings and admin stocks to allow users to create new stock with the same details.

## Implementation Details

### Core Functionality
The system now automatically deletes stock items when their quantity reaches zero. This applies to:

1. **Admin Stock**: When admin stock items reach zero quantity (after a seller purchases the last unit), the item is automatically deleted.
2. **Seller Listings**: When a seller's listing reaches zero quantity, it is automatically deleted.
3. **Inventory Items**: Zero-quantity inventory items are also deleted during inventory page load.

### Changes Made

#### Stock Service Modifications

1. **processStockPurchase Method**:
   - Now checks if admin stock will reach zero after purchase
   - Deletes the admin stock document if quantity becomes zero

2. **updateStockItem Method**:
   - Now checks if update would result in zero quantity
   - Deletes the stock item instead of updating if quantity is zero

3. **updateListing Method**:
   - Now checks if listing quantity is being updated to zero
   - Deletes the listing instead of updating if quantity is zero

4. **New Helper Methods**:
   - `cleanupZeroQuantityItems()`: Finds and removes all zero-quantity admin stock items and listings
   - `deleteZeroQuantityInventoryItems(sellerId)`: Removes zero-quantity inventory items for a specific seller
   - `cleanupAllSellersZeroInventory()`: Performs cleanup across all sellers' inventories
   - `initializePeriodicCleanup(intervalMinutes)`: Sets up periodic automatic cleanup

5. **Filtering Methods**:
   - Updated `getAllStockItems()` and `subscribeToAdminStock()` to explicitly filter out zero-quantity items
   - Added client-side filtering in inventory and listings pages for additional safety

#### UI Component Changes

1. **StockCleanupService**:
   - New client-side component that initializes periodic cleanup every 15 minutes
   - Runs an initial comprehensive cleanup of:
     - All admin stock items with zero quantity
     - All seller listings with zero quantity
     - All sellers' inventory items with zero quantity
   - Added to the main app layout for global application

2. **Inventory Page**:
   - Now filters out zero-quantity items for display
   - Calls `deleteZeroQuantityInventoryItems()` when loading to clean up any lingering zero-quantity items

3. **Listings Page**:
   - Now filters out zero-quantity listings for display

### Periodic Cleaning Schedule

1. **Regular Cleanup (15-minute intervals)**:
   - Cleans up zero-quantity admin stock items
   - Cleans up zero-quantity listings

2. **Comprehensive Cleanup (Random - ~33% chance each cycle)**:
   - Performs the above plus cleanup of all sellers' inventory items
   - Less frequent to avoid excessive database operations

## Benefits

1. **Data Consistency**: Ensures that depleted stock is properly removed from the database
2. **Resource Efficiency**: Prevents accumulation of unused stock items in the database
3. **Improved User Experience**: Allows users to recreate stock items with the same details after depletion
4. **Automatic Maintenance**: Periodic cleanup ensures the database stays clean even if real-time deletions fail
5. **Comprehensive Cleanup**: Handles all three types of zero-quantity items (admin stock, listings, and inventory)

## Testing

To verify this functionality:
1. Purchase the last available unit of an admin stock item
2. Observe that the item is deleted from admin stock
3. Try creating a new stock item with the same details
4. Confirm the new item can be created successfully
5. Check console logs to verify periodic cleanup is running
