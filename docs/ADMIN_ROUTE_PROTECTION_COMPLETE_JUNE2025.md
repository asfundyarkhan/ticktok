# Admin Route Protection Implementation - June 2025

## COMPLETED FIXES ✅

### 1. Zero-Quantity Stock Deletion Issue

- **Problem**: Admin-side stock items were being deleted when sellers purchased all available quantity
- **Solution**: Modified `StockService.processStockPurchase()` to update quantity to 0 instead of deleting the item
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/services/stockService.ts` - Removed deletion logic, always update stock quantity
  - Removed `where("stock", ">", 0)` filters from admin stock queries
  - Changed validation from `data.stock > 0` to `typeof data.stock === "number"`
- **Result**: Stock items now show "Out of Stock" instead of disappearing from admin view

### 2. Admin Route Protection Implementation

- **Problem**: Stock management pages weren't properly protected for admin-only access
- **Solution**: Wrapped all stock management pages with `AdminRoute` component
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/app/dashboard/stock/page.tsx` - Added AdminRoute wrapper
  - `src/app/dashboard/stock/add/page.tsx` - Added AdminRoute wrapper
  - `src/app/dashboard/stock/edit/[id]/page.tsx` - Already had AdminRoute protection
- **Result**: All stock management pages now require admin role access

## TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Stock Service Changes

```typescript
// BEFORE: Deleted items when reaching zero
if (newStockQuantity === 0) {
  t.delete(stockRef);
}

// AFTER: Always update, never delete
t.update(stockRef, {
  stock: newStockQuantity,
  updatedAt: Timestamp.now(),
});
```

### Admin Route Structure

```typescript
export default function StockPage() {
  return (
    <AdminRoute>
      <StockPageContent />
    </AdminRoute>
  );
}
```

## UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS

### Out of Stock Indicators

- Zero-quantity items now display "Out of Stock" badge in red
- Special action buttons for out-of-stock items:
  - "Add Stock" button (green) - redirects to edit page
  - "Edit" button (gray) - standard edit functionality
- Enhanced delete confirmation dialog with warnings for out-of-stock items

### Admin Navigation Flow

- Admin users are redirected to `/dashboard/admin` after login
- Non-admin users cannot access stock management pages
- Proper error handling and permission checks

## TESTING VERIFICATION

### Build Status

- ✅ Application builds successfully without errors
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation issues
- ✅ All imports and dependencies resolved correctly

### Development Server

- ✅ Development server starts successfully on port 3001
- ✅ All admin-protected routes properly secured
- ✅ Stock management functionality preserved

## FILES AFFECTED

### Core Logic Files

- `src/services/stockService.ts` - Stock processing and deletion fixes
