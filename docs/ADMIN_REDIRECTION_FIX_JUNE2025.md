# Admin Redirection Issue Fix - June 9, 2025

## Problem Solved

Admin users were being redirected away from the `/dashboard/admin` page instead of being able to access it. This was happening because admins would try to access their admin dashboard but get redirected to the main dashboard.

## Root Cause

The `/dashboard/admin/page.tsx` was using the `SuperAdminRoute` component, which only allows **superadmin** users and redirects **admin** users to `/dashboard`. This meant that:

1. Admin users log in → redirected to `/dashboard/admin` (correct)
2. `/dashboard/admin` page loads → `SuperAdminRoute` detects admin user → redirects to `/dashboard` (incorrect)
3. This created a situation where admins couldn't stay on their intended page

## Fix Applied

Changed the admin dashboard page to use `AdminRoute` instead of `SuperAdminRoute`:

**File Modified:** `src/app/dashboard/admin/page.tsx`

**Before:**

```tsx
import { SuperAdminRoute } from "../../components/SuperAdminRoute";

export default function AdminPage() {
  return (
    <SuperAdminRoute>
      <AdminPageContent />
    </SuperAdminRoute>
  );
}
```

**After:**

```tsx
import { AdminRoute } from "../../components/AdminRoute";

export default function AdminPage() {
  return (
    <AdminRoute>
      <AdminPageContent />
    </AdminRoute>
  );
}
```

## Component Behavior Differences

### AdminRoute

- **Allows:** admin AND superadmin users
- **Redirects others to:** `/store`
- **Used for:** Pages that both admins and superadmins should access

### SuperAdminRoute

- **Allows:** superadmin users ONLY
- **Redirects admin users to:** `/dashboard`
- **Redirects others to:** `/store`
- **Used for:** Pages that only superadmins should access (like role management, referral management)

## Expected Behavior After Fix

| User Role  | Login Redirect     | Can Access /dashboard/admin | Notes                            |
| ---------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| superadmin | `/dashboard`       | ✅ Yes                      | Can access all pages             |
| admin      | `/dashboard/admin` | ✅ Yes                      | **Fixed!** No more redirect loop |
| seller     | `/profile`         | ❌ No → `/store`            | Unchanged                        |
| user       | `/store`           | ❌ No → `/store`            | Unchanged                        |

## Verification

To verify the fix works:

1. Log in as an admin user
2. You should be redirected to `/dashboard/admin`
3. You should stay on that page (no more redirect loop)
4. Run the verification script: `scripts/verify-admin-fix.js` in browser console

## Pages That Remain SuperAdmin-Only

These pages correctly still use `SuperAdminRoute`:

- `/dashboard/admin/receipts` - Receipt management
- `/dashboard/admin/all-referrals` - All referrals view
- `/dashboard/referral-manager` - Referral management
- `/dashboard/role-manager` - Role management

## Status

✅ **FIXED** - Admin users can now access their admin dashboard without being redirected away.
