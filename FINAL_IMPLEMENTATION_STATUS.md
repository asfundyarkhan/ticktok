## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT STATUS:**

**STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE AND PRODUCTION READY**

All objectives have been successfully completed:

- Commission system with 100% rate
- Modern toast notification system
- Enhanced loading states and speed perception
- Professional user experience improvements
- Product images display fixed on stock/pending page
- Image aspect ratio warnings resolved

The admin panel now provides a significantly improved user experience with modern UI patterns, clear feedback, and optimized performance perception through loading states and toast notifications.

## 🖼️ **PRODUCT IMAGE FIX:**

The product images on the stock/pending page were not displaying correctly. We've made the following fixes:

1. **Image URL Handling**:

   - Corrected Firebase Storage URL construction for different path formats
   - Fixed the Firebase project ID from `ticktok-f7cd9` to `ticktokshop-5f1e9`
   - Added proper URL encoding for image paths

2. **Image Component Fixes**:

   - Added proper `style` attributes to fix aspect ratio warnings
   - Set `width: 'auto', height: 'auto'` with max constraints
   - Improved error handling for failed image loads

3. **Additional Improvements**:
   - Enhanced error logging for better debugging
   - Added multiple fallback strategies for image retrieval
   - Ensured consistent image display across desktop and mobile views
