# Firebase Storage Bucket CORS Fix

## Problem
Your deployed application is getting CORS errors because there's a mismatch between:
- Your Firebase configuration (pointing to `.appspot.com` format)
- The actual Firebase Storage bucket (which uses `.firebasestorage.app` format)

## Solution
The CORS configuration has been successfully applied to the correct bucket: `ticktokshop-5f1e9.firebasestorage.app`

Now you need to update your Vercel environment variables to use the correct bucket URL:

### Step 1: Update Vercel Environment Variable
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** > **Environment Variables**
4. Find `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
5. Update the value from `ticktokshop-5f1e9.appspot.com` to: 
   ```
   ticktokshop-5f1e9.firebasestorage.app
   ```

### Step 2: Redeploy
After updating the environment variable, redeploy your application:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

## Changes Made
1. ✅ Updated all Firebase configuration files to use `.firebasestorage.app` format
2. ✅ Applied CORS configuration to the correct bucket
3. ✅ Added support for your Vercel deployment URL: `https://tiktok-git-*.vercel.app`
4. ✅ Updated health check to expect the correct bucket format

## CORS Configuration Applied
The following domains are now allowed:
- `http://localhost:3000-3003` (development)
- `https://tiktok-*.vercel.app` (all tiktok Vercel deployments)
- `https://tiktok-git-*.vercel.app` (git-based deployments like yours)
- `https://*.vercel.app` (all Vercel deployments)
- `https://tiktokshophub.co` and variants (your main domain)
- All methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS

After updating the environment variable and redeploying, your stock listing functionality should work correctly!
