## 🔐 User Experience Flow

### Unauthenticated Users

1. **Main Page Access**:

   - See two buttons: "Browse Store" and "Get Started"
   - "Browse Store" directly navigates to store
   - "Get Started" redirects to login page

2. **Store Browsing**:

   - Can view all products and details
   - Can navigate through categories and search
   - Can view individual product pages

3. **Purchase Attempt**:
   - Login modal appears when trying to add to cart
   - Login modal appears when clicking product interaction buttons
   - Must authenticate to complete any purchase actions

### Authenticated Users

1. **Full Access**: Complete shopping experience with cart and checkout
2. **Navigation**: Store link always available in navigation
3. **Wallet Integration**: Full access to seller wallet features (if seller)

## 🛡️ Security Implementation

### Already Implemented (Previous Work)

- ✅ `LoginModal.tsx` component for authentication prompts
- ✅ Authentication checks in all product interaction handlers

- ✅ Product detail page (`/store/[id]/page.tsx`) with authentication guards
- ✅ Product grid (`ProductGrid.tsx`) with login modal integration
- ✅ Checkout system (`CheckoutButton.tsx`) with authentication requirements

### Authentication Trigger Points

## 🔧 Recent Fixes (June 26, 2025)

### Issue Resolution: Missing Routes & Permissions

#### 1. **Password Reset Route** (`/auth/reset-password`)

- ✅ **Fixed**: Created missing password reset page at `/auth/reset-password`
- ✅ **Features**:
  - Email validation and error handling
  - Firebase password reset integration
  - User-friendly UI with loading states
  - Navigation back to login page
- ✅ **Integration**: Added "Forgot Password" link to login page

#### 2. **Inventory Permissions Error**

- ✅ **Problem**: Users couldn't access their inventory (`FirebaseError: Missing or insufficient permissions`)
- ✅ **Root Cause**: Firestore security rules didn't match inventory collection structure
- ✅ **Solution**: Updated rules to match `inventory/{userId}/products/{productId}` path structure
- ✅ **Deployed**: Updated Firestore security rules deployed successfully

#### 3. **Error Details**

```javascript
// Before: Invalid rule structure
match /inventory/{userId}/{inventoryId} { ... }

// After: Correct rule structure
match /inventory/{userId}/products/{productId} { ... }
match /inventory/{userId}/products { ... } // For collection queries
```

### Updated Security Rules

The inventory access is now properly secured with these rules:

- ✅ Users can read/write their own inventory: `inventory/{userId}/products/*`
- ✅ Admins can access all inventories
- ✅ Public inventory items remain accessible for browsing

### Testing Status

- ✅ Password reset page accessible at `/auth/reset-password`
- ✅ "Forgot Password" link working on login page
- ✅ Firestore inventory rules deployed and active
- ✅ No more 404 errors for password reset
- ✅ Inventory permissions fixed for authenticated users

## 🎨 UI/UX Enhancements

### Main Page

- **Dual Action Design**: Clear distinction between browsing and purchasing flows
- **Visual Hierarchy**: "Get Started" remains primary CTA, "Browse Store" is secondary
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on mobile and desktop
- **Clear Messaging**: Users understand the difference between actions

### Navigation

- **Persistent Access**: Store link always visible in navigation
- **Active States**: Visual feedback for current page
- **Mobile Friendly**: Hamburger menu includes store access
- **Consistent Branding**: Maintains TikTok Shop design language

## ✅ Testing Status

### Build Status

- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ No build errors or warnings
- ✅ All imports and dependencies resolved

### Functionality Testing

- ✅ Main page displays both buttons correctly
- ✅ "Browse Store" navigates to store without login requirement
- ✅ "Get Started" maintains login requirement
- ✅ Navigation shows Store link in header
- ✅ Mobile navigation includes store access
- ✅ Store page loads for unauthenticated users

## 🚀 Ready for Production

The store access functionality is now fully implemented and ready for production use. Users can:

1. **Discover**: Browse the store from the main page without barriers
2. **Explore**: View all products and details without authentication
3. **Purchase**: Login seamlessly when ready to buy
4. **Navigate**: Access store from navigation at any time

This implementation maintains the existing wallet system functionality while providing a more accessible browsing experience for potential customers.

## 📱 Browser Testing

- ✅ Development server running on localhost:3000
- ✅ Main page accessible at `/main` with new buttons
