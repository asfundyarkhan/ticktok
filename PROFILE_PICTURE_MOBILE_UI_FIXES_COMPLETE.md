- **Loading States**: Shows loading spinner during upload
- **Toast Notifications**: Success/error feedback for users
- **Real-time Updates**: Profile picture updates immediately after upload

### Key Features:

## 2. Profile Page Mobile UI Fixes ✅

### Header Section

- **Responsive Design**: Smaller profile picture on mobile (20x20 vs 32x32)
- **Better Spacing**: Reduced padding for mobile screens
- **Camera Icon**: Properly sized for mobile (3x3 vs 4x4)

### Action Buttons

- **Stack Layout**: Buttons stack vertically on mobile
- **Full Width**: Mobile buttons use full width for better touch targets
- **Proper Spacing**: Consistent gap between buttons
- **Text Centering**: Centered text in Link buttons

### Content Layout

- **Responsive Grid**: Form fields adapt to screen size
- **Better Padding**: Reduced padding on small screens
- **Improved Typography**: Responsive text sizes

## 3. Admin Receipts Page Mobile UI Fixes ✅

### Modal Improvements

- **Better Positioning**: Centered modal with proper viewport handling
- **Responsive Sizing**: Adapts to screen size (max-w-md on mobile, max-w-lg on desktop)
- **Scrollable Content**: Modal content scrolls if too tall (max-h-[80vh])
- **Sticky Header**: Modal header stays visible when scrolling

### Mobile-First Design

- **Touch-Friendly**: Large touch targets for buttons
- **Stack Layout**: Buttons stack vertically on mobile
- **Image Optimization**: Receipt images display properly using Next.js Image component
- **Better Typography**: Improved text hierarchy and spacing

### Key Improvements:

```tsx
// Modal structure
- Centered positioning with proper backdrop
- Responsive max-width (md/lg breakpoints)
- Scrollable content area with sticky header
- Touch-friendly button layout

// Image handling
- Next.js Image component for optimization
- Proper aspect ratio handling
- Loading states for images
- Fallback for missing images
```
