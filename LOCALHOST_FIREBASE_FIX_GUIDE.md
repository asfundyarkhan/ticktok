# üîß Localhost Firebase Development Setup - Complete Fix Guide

## Issues Identified

Based on comprehensive testing, here are the localhost-specific Firebase issues and their solutions:

### 1. ‚ùå Anonymous Authentication Disabled

**Error:** `auth/admin-restricted-operation` or `auth/operation-not-allowed`
**Impact:** Users cannot sign in anonymously for testing/development

**Solution:**

1. Go to [Firebase Console Authentication](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/ticktokshop-5f1e9/authentication/providers)
2. Click on "Anonymous" in the Sign-in providers list
3. Toggle "Enable" to ON
4. Click "Save"

### 2. ‚ùå Localhost Not Added to Authorized Domains

**Error:** `auth/unauthorized-domain` (potential issue)
**Impact:** Authentication may fail from localhost

**Solution:**

1. Go to [Firebase Console Authentication](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/ticktokshop-5f1e9/authentication/settings)
2. Scroll to "Authorized domains"
3. Click "Add domain"
4. Add: `localhost`
5. Add: `127.0.0.1`
6. Click "Save"

### 3. ‚úÖ Firestore Rules Working Correctly

**Status:** Public collections (adminStock, listings) are accessible
**Status:** Protected collections (users) are properly secured

### 4. ‚úÖ Firebase Configuration Correct

**Status:** All Firebase config values are valid for localhost

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Enable Anonymous Authentication

```bash
# You need to do this manually in Firebase Console
echo "Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/ticktokshop-5f1e9/authentication/providers"
echo "Enable Anonymous authentication"
```

### Step 2: Add Localhost to Authorized Domains

```bash
# You need to do this manually in Firebase Console
echo "Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/ticktokshop-5f1e9/authentication/settings"
echo "Add localhost and 127.0.0.1 to authorized domains"
```

### Step 3: Test the Fixes

After making the above changes, test with:

- Node.js script: `node test-localhost-errors.js`
- Browser test: `http://localhost:3000/firebase-localhost-test.html`
- App diagnostic: `http://localhost:3000/localhost-diagnostic`

## üß™ Testing Commands

```bash
# Test Firebase from Node.js
node test-localhost-errors.js

# Start dev server and test in browser
npm run dev
# Then visit: http://localhost:3000/firebase-localhost-test.html
```

## üìù Expected Results After Fixes

### Anonymous Authentication

```
‚úÖ Anonymous sign-in successful: [user-id]
‚úÖ Auth state listener working
```

### Firestore Access

```
‚úÖ adminStock collection accessible: 680+ documents
‚úÖ listings collection accessible: 10+ documents
‚úÖ users collection properly protected: permission-denied
```

### Store Page

```
‚úÖ Products load without errors
‚úÖ Login modal works for unauthenticated users
‚úÖ No console errors for Firestore operations
```

## üîç Additional Debugging

If issues persist after the fixes:

1. **Check Browser Console:** Look for specific error codes
2. **Network Tab:** Check if requests to Firebase are blocked
3. **Firebase Console Logs:** Check for any project-level restrictions
4. **Clear Browser Cache:** Firebase auth tokens might be cached

## üö® Common Localhost-Only Issues

1. **CORS Issues:** Generally not a problem with Firebase, but check if using custom domains
2. **Cached Tokens:** Clear browser storage if auth behaves inconsistently
3. **Network Restrictions:** Corporate/school firewalls might block Firebase
4. **Browser Extensions:** Ad blockers might interfere with Firebase requests

## üìã Verification Checklist

- [ ] Anonymous authentication enabled in Firebase Console
- [ ] localhost added to authorized domains
- [ ] 127.0.0.1 added to authorized domains
- [ ] Node.js test passes: `node test-localhost-errors.js`
- [ ] Browser test passes: Anonymous auth works
- [ ] Store page loads products without errors
- [ ] Login modal appears for unauthenticated users
- [ ] No Firebase-related console errors

## üéØ Next Steps After Fixes

1. Test end-to-end user flows (login, purchase, seller operations)
2. Verify wallet and deposit functionality
3. Test all route protections work correctly
4. Confirm real-time features (if any) work on localhost
5. Test with different browsers to ensure compatibility

---

**Note:** The main issue is Anonymous Authentication being disabled. Once enabled, localhost development should work seamlessly.
