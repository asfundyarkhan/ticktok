# USDT Payment Option Implementation (Complete)

## Summary
This task involved removing bank transfer details and ensuring only USDT payment options are shown on all receipt and wallet pages.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created a reusable USDT payment information component
- Created `USDTPaymentInfo.tsx` component that displays:
  - USDT TRC20 wallet address
  - QR code for payments
  - Important payment instructions

### 2. Updated Receipt Submission Component
- Added the USDT payment information to `ReceiptSubmission.tsx`
- Ensured users only see USDT payment options

### 3. Updated Receipts-v2 Page
- Added standalone USDT payment information section
- Added image import for QR code display

### 4. Updated redirects
- Modified old receipts page to redirect to receipts-v2
- Updated wallet page to redirect to receipts-v2 instead of receipts

### 5. Reviewed Admin Pages
- Verified admin receipts-v2 page doesn't contain bank transfer details
- No changes were needed for admin pages

## Benefits
