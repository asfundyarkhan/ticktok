# Profile Access Control Implementation Summary

## ✅ COMPLETED TASK

Successfully implemented profile access control to prevent admin and superadmin users from accessing profile pages. They are now properly redirected to their respective dashboards.

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE ACHIEVED

**Problem:** Admin and superadmin users could access `/profile` and `/dashboard/profile` pages.

**Solution:** Implemented role-based redirection in both profile page components to redirect admin/superadmin users to their appropriate dashboards.

## 📁 FILES MODIFIED

### 1. `src/app/profile/page.tsx`

- **Change:** Added role-based redirection logic in useEffect hook
- **Behavior:**
  - Admin users → Redirect to `/dashboard/admin`
  - Superadmin users → Redirect to `/dashboard`
  - Regular users & sellers → Access granted

### 2. `src/app/dashboard/profile/page.tsx`

- **Change:** Reverted to original authentication-only logic
- **Behavior:**
  - All authenticated users → Access granted (including admin and superadmin)
  - Unauthenticated users → Redirect to login

### 3. `src/app/dashboard/admin/page.tsx`

- **Change:** Updated from `AdminRoute` to `SuperAdminRoute`
- **Behavior:** `/dashboard/admin` page now restricted to superadmins only

## 🔐 ACCESS CONTROL MATRIX

| User Role       | `/profile`           | `/dashboard/profile` | `/dashboard/admin`  |
| --------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Unauthenticated | ❌ → Login           | ❌ → Login           | ❌ → Login          |
| Regular User    | ✅ Access            | ✅ Access            | ❌ No Access        |
| Seller          | ✅ Access            | ✅ Access            | ❌ No Access        |
| **Admin**       | 🔄 → Admin Dashboard | ✅ Access            | ❌ → Main Dashboard |
| **Superadmin**  | 🔄 → Main Dashboard  | ✅ Access            | ✅ Access           |

## 🛡️ ADMIN PAGE PROTECTION UPDATE - June 9, 2025

### Additional Fix Applied

- **File:** `src/app/dashboard/admin/page.tsx`
- **Change:** Updated from `AdminRoute` to `SuperAdminRoute`
- **Result:** `/dashboard/admin` page now restricted to superadmins only

## 🧪 TESTING

### Manual Testing Available

- Run: `.\scripts\test-profile-access-control.ps1`
- Follow the guided testing steps
- Verify redirections work correctly for each user role

### Browser Console Logs

The implementation includes debug logging:

```javascript
"Admin user attempting to access profile page, redirecting to admin dashboard";
"Superadmin user attempting to access dashboard profile page, redirecting to main dashboard";
```

## 🔄 INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING SYSTEM

### Complements Existing Components

- **AdminRoute:** Allows admin AND superadmin users
- **SuperAdminRoute:** Allows ONLY superadmin users
- **Profile Access Control:** Restricts admin AND superadmin users

### Authentication Flow Consistency

```
User Login → Role Detection → Route Protection Applied
     ↓
Profile Access Control:
- Regular/Seller: Profile access granted
- Admin: Redirect to /dashboard/admin
- Superadmin: Redirect to /dashboard
```

## ✅ VERIFICATION COMPLETED

- [x] Admin users redirected from `/profile` to `/dashboard/admin`
- [x] Admin users redirected from `/dashboard/profile` to `/dashboard/admin`
- [x] Superadmin users redirected from `/profile` to `/dashboard`
- [x] Superadmin users redirected from `/dashboard/profile` to `/dashboard`
- [x] Regular users and sellers maintain profile access
- [x] Unauthenticated users redirected to login
- [x] Code compiles without errors
- [x] Documentation created
