# Image Fallback Mechanism Removal

## Purpose

This change removes the fallback mechanism from image helper functions to expose actual errors with missing images. This is a debugging step to help identify which components are attempting to render images without valid image URLs.

## Changes Made

1. **Modified `getBestProductImage` function:**
   - Now throws errors instead of returning `null` when images aren't found
   - Added detailed error messages to help identify problematic items

2. **Modified `getFirestoreImage` function:**
   - Removed null-check fallback
   - Added additional debug logging for image URLs
   - Will now propagate errors from `getBestProductImage` rather than handling them

## Expected Behavior

After this change:

1. **Console errors will be more informative:**
   - You'll see specific error messages about which items are missing images
   - The error messages will include JSON stringification of the item objects to help identify the problematic data

2. **Component rendering will fail:**
   - Components that previously silently handled missing images will now crash
   - This will make it easier to identify which components need attention

## How to Find Issues

1. Check the browser console for errors like:
   - `Error: No image found for item: {...}`
   - `Error: Item object is null or undefined`

2. Look for component rendering errors in React which will point to where images are missing

## Reverting Back

If you want to revert to the fallback mechanism after debugging:

1. Change `getBestProductImage` to return `null` instead of throwing errors
2. Restore the null check in `getFirestoreImage`

## Benefits of This Approach

By temporarily removing fallbacks, you can:
- Find all places where images are missing
- Fix the root cause of missing images
- Ensure your data contains proper image fields
- Improve overall application stability
