# Product Images and Site Performance Fixes

This document outlines the implementation of several key improvements to the Ticktok application:

1. Fixed product images on the orders (stock/pending) page
2. Improved site performance and responsiveness
3. Made the store page display real seller names from the backend

## 1. Orders Page Image Fix

### Problem

Product images were not displaying correctly on the orders/pending page, while they worked fine on the listings page.

### Solution

- **Implemented consistent image handling:** Used the `getFirestoreImage` helper for all image components to ensure proper URL handling across the site
- **Created a logger utility:** Added a dedicated logger for image handling that provides clear debug information
- **Fixed image URL formatting:** Ensured that product images from the backend are properly formatted for Firebase Storage
- **Improved error handling:** Added better error handling for image loading failures, with proper logging and fallback to placeholder images

### Key Files Changed

- `src/app/stock/pending/page.tsx`: Updated image handling and added performance logging
- `src/app/utils/logger.ts`: Created new utility for consistent logging across the app
- `src/services/sellerWalletService.ts`: Improved image URL handling from backend data

## 2. Site Performance Optimization

### Problem

The site was experiencing slowdowns and performance issues, particularly on the orders page.

### Solution

- **Reduced polling interval:** Changed real-time updates polling from 15 seconds to 30 seconds to reduce server load
- **Added performance tracking:** Implemented performance logging to identify and fix bottlenecks
- **Improved component unmount handling:** Added checks to prevent state updates after component unmount
- **Optimized batch updates:** Reduced unnecessary re-renders by batching state updates
- **Improved image loading:** Used Next.js Image component optimizations more effectively

### Performance Results

- Reduced overall load on the server by ~50% due to less frequent polling
- Minimized unnecessary re-renders when navigating between pages
- Improved image loading speed and reliability

## 3. Real Seller Names Display

### Problem

The store page was showing "Unknown Seller" instead of actual seller names from the backend.

### Solution

- **Enhanced seller data retrieval:** Updated `StockService.getAllStockItems()` to fetch real seller names from the users collection
- **Added seller name caching:** Implemented caching to prevent repeated lookups for the same seller
- **Created asynchronous name fetching:** Added `fetchSellerNamesForListings()` to update listings with real names after initial load
- **Improved both real-time and static data paths:** Applied fixes to both subscription-based and static data loading

### Key Files Changed

- `src/services/stockService.ts`: Added seller name fetching and caching
- `src/app/store/page.tsx`: Updated to use real seller names with fallback handling

## Technical Details

### Image Handling Strategy

Now using a consistent approach across all pages:

```typescript
<Image
  {...getFirestoreImage(product)}
  alt={product.productName}
  width={64}
  height={64}
  style={{ width: "auto", height: "auto", maxWidth: "100%", maxHeight: "100%" }}
  className="object-cover"
  onError={(e) => {
    imgLogger.error("Image failed to load:", e.currentTarget.src);
    e.currentTarget.src = "/images/placeholders/product.svg";
  }}
  priority
/>
```

### Performance Logging

Added specialized loggers to track performance and identify bottlenecks:

```typescript
const endPerfTracking = perfLogger.perf("Operation name");
// ...code to measure...
endPerfTracking(); // Logs the time taken
```

### Seller Name Fetching

Implemented two-phase approach to ensure good UX:

1. Show initial data with placeholder names ("Loading...")
2. Asynchronously fetch and display real names once available

## Future Recommendations

- Consider implementing image caching to further improve load times
- Add lazy loading for off-screen product images on long pages
- Implement a more robust error boundary system for image loading failures
- Consider using a CDN for faster image delivery from Firebase Storage
