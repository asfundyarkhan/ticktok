# Product Pool Page - Remove Redirect After Listing Fix ✅

## Issue Resolved
When sellers listed products from the product pool page (`/stock`), they were automatically redirected to the listings page (`/stock/listings`) after 2 seconds, which interrupted their workflow when they wanted to list multiple products.

## Problem Location
**File**: `src/app/stock/page.tsx`
**Lines**: 170-172

```tsx
// OLD CODE (REMOVED):
setTimeout(() => {
  window.location.href = "/stock/listings";
}, 2000);
```

## Solution Implemented
Removed the automatic redirect and modified the success flow to only reset the quantity counter, allowing sellers to stay on the same page and continue listing more products.

```tsx
// NEW CODE:
// Reset quantity only (stay on same page)
handleQuantityChange(productId, 0);
```

## User Experience Improvement

### After Fix:
1. Seller selects product and quantity
2. Sets markup and clicks "List Product"
3. Success message appears

5. Can immediately list more products without navigation

## Benefits
