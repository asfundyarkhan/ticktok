# Role Manager Component Fix

## Problem

The role manager component in the TikTok Shop application was throwing the following error:

```
Error: (0 , _services_userService__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_2__.updateUserProfile) is not a function
src\app\dashboard\role-manager\page.tsx (29:30) @ handleSubmit
```

This occurred when attempting to update a user's role status via the role manager interface.

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by an incorrect import and usage of the `UserService` class. The component was trying to use `updateUserProfile` as a standalone function, but it's actually a static method on the `UserService` class.

Additionally, the component was trying to update a user's role by email directly, but the `updateUserProfile` method requires a user ID (uid).

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed imports in role-manager/page.tsx**

   - Changed from importing a non-existent standalone function to importing the `UserService` class

   ```diff
   - import { updateUserProfile } from "../../../services/userService";
   + import { UserService } from "../../../services/userService";
   ```

2. **Updated the handleSubmit function to:**

   - First find the user by email to get their uid
   - Then use the uid to update the role
   - Handle errors properly with TypeScript

   ```typescript
   const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
     e.preventDefault();
     // ...
     try {
       // First, find the user by email to get their uid
       const userByEmail = await UserService.getUserByEmail(email);

       if (!userByEmail) {
         throw new Error(`User with email ${email} not found`);
       }

       // Update the user's role based on the selected role
       if (role === "seller") {
         // Use the dedicated method for upgrading to seller
         await UserService.upgradeToSeller(userByEmail.uid);
       } else {
         // Use the general update method for other roles
         await UserService.updateUserProfile(userByEmail.uid, { role });
       }

       // Success message
       // ...
     } catch (error: unknown) {
       // Error handling with proper TypeScript typing
       // ...
     }
   };
   ```

3. **Added backward compatibility in userService.ts**

   - Added a standalone `updateUserProfile` export function that internally calls the static method
   - This ensures any existing code using the function directly won't break

   ```typescript
   // Export the updateUserProfile function for backward compatibility
   export const updateUserProfile = async (
     uid: string,
     data: Partial<UserProfile>
   ): Promise<void> => {
     return UserService.updateUserProfile(uid, data);
   };
   ```

4. **Fixed TypeScript issues:**
   - Added proper type declarations for all variables
   - Fixed TypeScript errors related to unused variables
   - Added proper type handling for form events and error handling

## Testing

The role manager component should now function correctly:

1. Enter a valid email address of an existing user
2. Select a role from the dropdown
3. Click "Update Role"

The component will:

1. Look up the user by email
2. If found, update their role in Firestore
3. Show a success message
4. If not found or if there's an error, show an appropriate error message

## Future Considerations

1. Consider implementing a user search feature to ensure users exist before attempting role changes
2. Add a confirmation step before changing sensitive roles like "admin" or "superadmin"
3. Add logging for role changes to maintain an audit trail
4. Consider adding pagination if the user base grows large
