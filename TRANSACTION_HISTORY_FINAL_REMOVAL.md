# Transaction History Section Removal - Final

## Changes Made

Successfully removed the "Transaction History" section under "Referred Sellers" from the commission dashboard as requested.

### 1. Removed Transaction History Section

**File**: `src/app/dashboard/commission/page.tsx`

**Removed**:

```tsx
{
  /* Transaction History */
}
<div className="mb-8">
  <CommissionHistory maxItems={20} />
</div>;
```

### 2. Removed Unused Import

**File**: `src/app/dashboard/commission/page.tsx`

**Removed**:

```tsx
import CommissionHistory from "../../components/CommissionHistory";
```

## Final Commission Dashboard Structure

The commission dashboard now shows only:

1. **Header**: "Commission Dashboard" with description
2. **Commission Balance Card**: "My Revenue Overview"
3. **Commission Breakdown Grid**: Three summary cards
   - Superadmin Deposits: $0.00
   - Receipt Approvals: $0.00
   - Total Transactions: 0
4. **Important Note**: Commission balance information
