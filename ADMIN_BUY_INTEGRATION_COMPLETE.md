## System Flow

### New Admin Account Creation

1. Superadmin uses role manager to upgrade user to admin
2. `UserService.upgradeToAdmin()` is called
3. User role is updated to 'admin'
4. Balance is automatically set to 99999
5. User can immediately access buy page and make purchases

### Existing Admin Balance Update

1. Superadmin uses "Update Admin Balance" section in role manager
2. `UserService.ensureAdminBalance()` is called
3. Balance is updated to 99999 if current balance is lower
4. Admin account is ready for purchases

### Admin Purchase Process

1. Admin accesses `/dashboard/admin/buy` page
2. Views all seller listings with real-time data
3. Clicks "Buy Now" on desired product
4. `StockService.processAdminPurchase()` processes purchase
5. No fees deducted - 100% payment goes to seller
6. Stock quantity reduced by 1
7. Admin balance decreases by purchase amount
8. Seller balance increases immediately
