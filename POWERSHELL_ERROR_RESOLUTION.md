# PowerShell Error Resolution & Current Status

## 🚨 PowerShell Error Explanation

The error you encountered:

```
Missing expression after unary operator '-'.
Unexpected token 'C:\Ticktok\ticktok\.next\server\...' in expression or statement.
```

This happens when PowerShell interprets file paths starting with `-` as command parameters. This typically occurs when:

1. **Copying commands incorrectly** - Commands with dashes at the beginning of lines
2. **Running build outputs** - Trying to execute build file listings
3. **Incorrect command syntax** - Missing quotes around file paths

## ✅ Current Implementation Status

### 🛍️ Store Access Implementation: WORKING ✅

1. **Development Server**: ✅ Running successfully on localhost:3000
2. **Main Page**: ✅ Accessible at `/main` with both buttons working
   - "Browse Store" button → Direct access to store (no login required)
   - "Get Started" button → Redirects to login page
3. **Store Page**: ✅ Accessible at `/store` for all users
4. **Navigation**: ✅ Store link in header navigation working
5. **Authentication Flow**: ✅ Login modal appears for purchase attempts

### 🔧 How to Safely Use PowerShell

**✅ Correct Commands:**

```powershell
npm run dev
npm run build
npm start
```

**❌ Avoid These Patterns:**

```powershell
# Don't copy build output directly
- C:\Ticktok\ticktok\.next\server\webpack-runtime.js
- C:\Ticktok\ticktok\.next\server\pages\_document.js

# Don't run raw file paths
C:\Ticktok\ticktok\node_modules\next\dist\server\require.js
```

**💡 PowerShell Best Practices:**

1. Use quotes around file paths: `"C:\path\to\file"`
2. Use forward slashes when possible: `C:/path/to/file`
3. Run npm commands from project root
4. Use VS Code integrated terminal for best compatibility

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### ✅ Completed Tests
