🎯 COMMISSION SYSTEM VALIDATION TEST

✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:
1. Commission balance tracking (separate from referral balance)
2. Commission earned ONLY from superadmin deposits and receipt approvals
3. No commission from product sales (key requirement)
4. Real-time commission balance updates
5. Commission transaction history
6. Role-based commission dashboards

📋 MANUAL TESTING CHECKLIST:

Step 1: Test Commission Dashboard Access
👉 Login as an admin user
👉 Navigate to /dashboard/commission
👉 Should see commission balance breakdown:
   - Total commission balance
   - Commission from superadmin deposits
   - Commission from receipt approvals
   - Commission transaction history

Step 2: Test Superadmin Deposit Commission
👉 Login as a superadmin
👉 Navigate to /dashboard/admin
👉 Add credits to a seller who was referred by an admin
👉 Check:
   - Seller balance increases by full amount
   - Admin commission balance increases by 10% of deposit
   - Commission transaction is recorded
   - Real-time updates work

Step 3: Test Receipt Approval Commission
👉 Login as a seller (referred by an admin)
👉 Navigate to /receipts
👉 Submit a payment receipt
👉 Login as superadmin and approve the receipt
👉 Check:
   - Seller balance increases by receipt amount
   - Admin commission balance increases by 10% of receipt amount
   - Commission transaction is recorded with receipt ID

Step 4: Test Commission vs Referral Balance Separation
👉 Verify that commission balance is separate from referral balance
👉 Commission balance only tracks deposits/receipts (10% rate)
👉 Referral balance tracks sum of all referred users' current balances
👉 These should be different numbers

Step 5: Test Real-time Updates
👉 Open commission dashboard in multiple browser tabs
👉 Process a commission-generating transaction in another tab
👉 All commission dashboards should update instantly

Step 6: Test Superadmin Commission Overview
👉 Login as superadmin
👉 Navigate to /dashboard
👉 Check "Total Commission Balance Overview" card
👉 Should show:
   - Combined commission balance of all admins
   - Number of admins with commissions
   - Breakdown by deposit vs receipt sources

🔧 TECHNICAL VALIDATION POINTS:

✅ Firebase Collections Created:
- commission_balances (stores admin commission totals)
- commission_transactions (audit trail of all commission payments)

✅ Commission Service Methods:
- recordSuperadminDeposit() - Records 10% commission on deposits
- recordReceiptApprovalCommission() - Records 10% commission on receipt approvals
- getAdminCommissionBalance() - Gets current commission balance
- getAdminCommissionSummary() - Gets detailed breakdown
- getTotalCommissionBalance() - Gets system-wide totals

✅ Integration Points:
- UserService.addUserBalance() triggers commission recording
- ReceiptService.approveReceipt() triggers commission recording
- Real-time Firebase listeners for instant updates

🚨 IMPORTANT TESTING NOTES:

1. Commission Rate: Fixed at 10% (COMMISSION_RATE = 0.1)
2. Commission Sources: ONLY deposits and receipt approvals
3. Product Sales: Should NOT generate any commissions
4. Commission Balance: Separate from referral balance system
5. Real-time Updates: Should work across all commission components

🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA:

✅ Admin can see their commission balance dashboard
✅ Superadmin deposits generate 10% commission for admin
✅ Receipt approvals generate 10% commission for admin
✅ Product sales do NOT generate commissions
✅ Commission balance is separate from referral balance
✅ Real-time updates work correctly
✅ Transaction history shows commission audit trail
✅ Superadmin can see total commission overview

📊 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:

If a superadmin deposits $100 to a seller referred by AdminA:
- Seller balance: +$100
- AdminA commission balance: +$10
- Commission transaction recorded: "superadmin_deposit", $10

If a receipt for $50 is approved for a seller referred by AdminB:
- Seller balance: +$50
- AdminB commission balance: +$5
- Commission transaction recorded: "receipt_approval", $5
