# Pending Page (Orders) Image Display Fix

## Issue
Product images were displaying correctly in the listings page but not in the orders (pending) page.

## Root Cause
The issue was due to inconsistent image handling between the two pages:

1. **Listings Page**:
   - Used the `getBestProductImage()` and `getFirestoreImage()` utility functions from `imageHelpers.ts`
   - These functions properly handle different image field formats and Firebase Storage URLs

2. **Pending Page**:
   - Used direct checks on `product.productImage` property
   - Didn't leverage the existing image utility functions
   - Was missing the mainImage and images[] fields expected by the utility functions
   - Manual conditional handling was prone to errors

## Solution Implemented

1. **Added Image Helper Utilities**:
   - Imported `getBestProductImage` and `getFirestoreImage` from `imageHelpers.ts`
   - Used `getFirestoreImage()` to handle image src and optimization settings

2. **Updated Data Model**:
   - Extended the `PendingProductWithProfit` interface to include mainImage and images[]
   - Made the data structure compatible with the existing image helper functions

3. **Enhanced Data Mapping**:
   - Updated the mapping logic to populate all image-related fields
   - Ensured consistency with how images are processed in the listings page

4. **Removed Manual Unoptimized Flag**:
   - Let the `getFirestoreImage()` function handle unoptimized settings automatically
   - This ensures Firebase Storage URLs are handled properly

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Consistency**: The orders page now uses the same image handling logic as the listings page
2. **Reliability**: Images are processed through proven utility functions with proper fallbacks
3. **Maintainability**: Less duplicate code, easier to update image handling in the future
4. **Performance**: Proper optimization settings for different types of image sources

## Testing

Verified that product images now display correctly on the orders page matching the listings page behavior.
