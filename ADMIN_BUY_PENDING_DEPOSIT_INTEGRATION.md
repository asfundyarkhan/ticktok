# Admin Buy Page Pending Deposit Integration - Complete âœ…

## Summary

The admin buy page has been successfully updated to integrate with the new pending deposit workflow while maintaining backward compatibility with legacy products.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated StockService.processAdminPurchase()
**File:** `src/services/stockService.ts`

#### Key Changes:
- **Pending Deposit Detection**: Checks if the purchased product has a pending deposit entry
- **Dual System Support**: Handles both new pending deposit system and legacy direct payment system
- **Proper Sale Processing**: Uses `PendingDepositService.markProductSold()` for new system products
- **Complete Transaction Flow**: Creates purchase records, pending product entries, and updates listings

#### New System Flow (Products with Pending Deposits):
1. Detect pending deposit for the product
2. Update listing quantity in transaction
3. Process sale through `PendingDepositService.markProductSold()` - this adds only the profit to seller's wallet
4. Create admin purchase record with `usesPendingDepositSystem: true` flag
5. Create pending product entry for receipt upload workflow
6. No admin balance check required (admin purchases are always allowed)

#### Legacy System Flow (Products without Pending Deposits):
1. Check admin balance before purchase
2. Transfer full amount from admin to seller
3. Update listing quantity
4. Create purchase record with `usesPendingDepositSystem: false` flag

### 2. Added Required Imports
- Added `setDoc` import to Firebase imports for purchase record creation

## How It Works

### For New System Products (With Pending Deposits):
1. **Admin initiates purchase** â†’ Admin Buy page calls `StockService.processAdminPurchase()`
2. **System detects pending deposit** â†’ Looks up pending deposit by productId and sellerId
3. **Processes sale correctly** â†’ Uses `PendingDepositService.markProductSold()` which:
   - Calculates profit (sale price - original cost)
   - Adds only profit to seller's available wallet balance
   - Keeps original cost as pending deposit amount
   - Blocks withdrawals until deposit is paid
4. **Creates tracking records** â†’ Purchase record and pending product entry
5. **Updates listing** â†’ Reduces quantity in marketplace listing

### For Legacy Products (Without Pending Deposits):
1. **Standard admin purchase flow** â†’ Checks admin balance and transfers full amount
2. **Direct payment** â†’ Full sale amount goes to seller immediately
3. **Normal withdrawal** â†’ Seller can withdraw funds immediately

## User Experience

### Admin Users:
- **Seamless purchases** â†’ No change in UI/UX, same purchase flow
- **No balance requirements** â†’ Admin purchases always proceed for new system products
- **Clear status messages** â†’ Different success messages indicate which system was used

### Sellers:
- **Correct profit handling** â†’ Only markup profit added to available balance for new system
- **Pending deposit tracking** â†’ Original stock cost remains as pending deposit
- **Withdrawal restrictions** â†’ Cannot withdraw until pending deposit is paid
- **Receipt workflow** â†’ Same pending product creation for receipt uploads

## Files Modified

- `src/services/stockService.ts` - Updated `processAdminPurchase()` method
- `src/app/dashboard/admin/buy/page.tsx` - Uses existing `processAdminPurchase()` (no changes needed)

## Implementation Status: âœ… COMPLETE

All admin purchase flows now use the unified pending deposit logic while maintaining full backward compatibility.

## Console Debugging

The updated implementation includes comprehensive console logging:

- Pending deposit search results
- System selection (new vs legacy)
- Sale processing outcomes
- Error details for troubleshooting

Watch for these logs when testing:
```
Admin purchase attempt - productId: [ID], sellerId: [ID]
Pending deposit search result - found: [true/false], deposit: [object]
Using new pending deposit system for admin purchase of product [ID]
Using old system for admin purchase of product [ID] - no pending deposit found
Successfully processed admin purchase with pending deposit system
```

The admin buy integration is now complete and ready for testing! ðŸŽ‰
