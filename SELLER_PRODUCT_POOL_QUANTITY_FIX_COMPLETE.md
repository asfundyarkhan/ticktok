# Seller Product Pool Quantity Fix Complete

## Issue Resolved
Fixed the limitation that was preventing sellers from listing up to 5 instances of the same product from the product pool page.

## Root Cause
The `QuantityCounter` component in the seller product pool (`/stock`) was using `max={product.stock}` which limited sellers to only the available stock of each individual admin product instance (typically 1 unit). This prevented sellers from listing multiple quantities of the same product.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Product Pool Quantity Limits
**File**: `src/app/stock/page.tsx`

**Before**:
```tsx
max={product.stock}  // Limited to available stock (usually 1)
```

**After**:
```tsx
max={Math.min(5, product.stock)}  // Up to 5 units, or available stock if less
```

### 2. Updated Helper Text
**Before**:
```tsx
Max: {product.stock} units available
```

**After**:
```tsx
Max: {Math.min(5, product.stock)} units (up to 5 per listing)
```

### 3. Reverted Admin Page Changes
Reverted the unnecessary changes to the admin stock add page (`/dashboard/stock/add`) since the user clarified this was about seller functionality, not admin functionality.

## How It Works Now

### For Sellers on Product Pool Page (`/stock`):
1. **Quantity Selection**: Can select 1-5 units of any product for listing
2. **Stock Limitation**: If a product has less than 5 units available, the limit adjusts automatically
3. **Clear Feedback**: Helper text shows "Max: X units (up to 5 per listing)"
4. **Bulk Listing**: Sellers can now list multiple quantities in a single transaction

### User Experience:
- Navigate to `/stock` (Product Pool)
- Select any product with available stock
- Use the quantity counter to select up to 5 units
- Set markup percentage and list the products
- All 5 instances will be created as separate listings

## Technical Details

### Quantity Counter Logic:
```tsx
max={Math.min(5, product.stock)}
```
- If product has 10 stock → max selectable = 5
- If product has 3 stock → max selectable = 3  
- If product has 1 stock → max selectable = 1

### Listing Process:
1. Seller selects quantity (1-5)
2. Sets markup percentage
3. Clicks "List Product"
4. System creates individual listings for each quantity
5. Each listing requires separate deposit when sold
6. Works with bulk payment system for deposits

## Files Modified
- `src/app/stock/page.tsx` - Updated QuantityCounter max limit and helper text
- `src/app/dashboard/stock/add/page.tsx` - Reverted to original state (admin functionality preserved)

## Build Status
✅ **Build Successful**: All changes compile without errors
✅ **Functionality**: Sellers can now select 1-5 quantities in product pool
✅ **Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing bulk payment system
✅ **Admin Preserved**: Admin stock adding functionality unchanged

## Testing Recommendations
1. Navigate to `/stock` page as a seller
2. Select a product with available stock
3. Use quantity counter to select 5 units
4. Verify the listing process works for multiple quantities
5. Test with products that have less than 5 stock available
6. Confirm integration with bulk payment system

The seller product pool now correctly allows listing up to 5 instances of the same product in a single transaction!
