# Store Seller Access & Mobile Filter Implementation

## Overview
This update makes the store accessible to sellers while preventing them from purchasing items, and adds a mobile-friendly filter system similar to modern e-commerce stores.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Product Navigation for All Users
**Problem**: Sellers couldn't click on product images to view product details.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `ProductGrid.tsx` to allow all users (including sellers) to navigate to product detail pages
- Removed the login requirement for viewing product details

```tsx
const handleProductClick = (product: StockItem) => {
  // Allow all users (including sellers) to view product details
  if (product.id) {
    router.push(`/store/${product.id}`);
  }
};
```

### 2. Seller Purchase Prevention
**Problem**: Sellers could add items to cart and attempt to purchase.

**Solution**: 
- Added seller role checks in multiple locations:
  - **Store page**: Prevents adding items to cart with informative message
  - **Checkout page**: Clears cart and redirects to store if seller attempts checkout

**Store Page Prevention**:
```tsx
if (userProfile?.role === "seller") {
  toast.error("Sellers cannot purchase items. Please browse as a regular user.");
  return;
}
```

**Checkout Page Prevention**:
```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (userProfile?.role === "seller" && cartItems.length > 0) {
    toast.error("Sellers cannot purchase items. Your cart has been cleared.");
    clearCart();
    window.location.href = "/store";
    return;
  }
}, [userProfile, cartItems.length, clearCart]);
```

### 3. Mobile Filter Modal
**Problem**: Desktop-only sidebar filter was not mobile-friendly.

**Solution**: 
- Created new `FilterModal.tsx` component with mobile-first design
- Responsive layout that shows filters differently on mobile vs desktop
- Modern e-commerce style filter interface

**Features**:
- **Mobile**: Filter button that opens a modal with all filters
- **Desktop**: Traditional sidebar layout (unchanged)
- **Categories**: Integrated into filter modal
- **Price Range**: Responsive slider component
- **Sizes**: Grid layout for easy selection
- **Clear All**: Reset all filters at once

### 4. Responsive Store Layout
**Problem**: Fixed desktop grid layout didn't work well on mobile.

**Solution**:
- Updated store page layout to be fully responsive
- Mobile-first filter button approach
- Conditional rendering based on screen size

```tsx
{/* Mobile Filter Button */}
<div className="lg:hidden mb-4">
  <button onClick={() => setShowFilterModal(true)}>
    Filters
  </button>
</div>

{/* Desktop Filters */}
<div className="hidden lg:block lg:col-span-3">
  <FilterSidebar />
</div>
```
