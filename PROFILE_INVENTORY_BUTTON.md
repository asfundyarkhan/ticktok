# Profile Page Inventory Button Implementation

## Summary

Added an "Inventory" button to the seller profile page to provide easy navigation to the seller's inventory management page.

## Changes Made

### 1. Profile Page Enhancement (`src/app/profile/page.tsx`)

- **Added Inventory Button**: Added a blue "Inventory" button next to the "Edit Profile" button
- **Role-based Display**: Button only appears for users with `role === "seller"`
- **Navigation**: Button links to `/stock/inventory` page
- **Styling**: Consistent with existing button design patterns

### 2. Code Implementation

```tsx
{
  userProfile.role === "seller" && (
    <Link
      href="/stock/inventory"
      className="px-4 py-2 border border-transparent rounded-md shadow-sm text-sm font-medium text-white bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 focus:outline-none"
    >
      Inventory
    </Link>
  );
}
```

## Features

- ✅ **Role-based Access**: Only visible to sellers
- ✅ **Consistent Styling**: Matches application design system
- ✅ **Proper Navigation**: Direct link to inventory management
- ✅ **User Experience**: Solves seller navigation issue
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes

## Testing

- ✅ **Compilation**: No errors in profile page
- ✅ **Server Status**: Development server running successfully
- ✅ **Browser Access**: Profile page accessible at `http://localhost:3001/profile`
- ✅ **Button Display**: Inventory button shows for seller role

## Navigation Flow

1. **Seller Login** → Redirected to `/profile`
2. **Profile Page** → Shows "Inventory" button for sellers
3. **Click Inventory** → Navigates to `/stock/inventory`
4. **Inventory Page** → Seller can manage their stock and create listings

## Resolution

This change resolves the issue where sellers had no easy way to navigate from their profile page to their inventory management system. Now sellers have a clear, prominent button to access their inventory directly from their main landing page.
