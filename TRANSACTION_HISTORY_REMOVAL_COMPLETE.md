# Transaction History Section Removal - Complete

## Changes Made

Based on the user's request to remove the "Transaction History" tab and "Commission History" text from the commission dashboard, I have successfully implemented the following changes:

### 1. Removed Transaction History Section

**File**: `src/app/dashboard/commission/page.tsx`

**Changes Made**:

- ✅ **Removed entire "Transaction History" section** - The section that displayed the CommissionHistory component
- ✅ **Removed unused CommissionHistory import** - Cleaned up unused import statement
- ✅ **Maintained all other functionality** - Commission balance card and breakdown remain intact

### Before (What was removed):

```tsx
{
  /* Transaction History */
}
<div className="mb-8">
  <CommissionHistory maxItems={20} />
</div>;
```

### After:

The Transaction History section is completely removed, leaving only:

- Commission Balance Card (My Revenue Overview)
- Commission Breakdown (From Superadmin Deposits / From Receipt Approvals)
- Important Note section

## UI Impact

### What's Gone:

- ❌ **"Transaction History" section** - No longer displays transaction list
- ❌ **"Commission History" text** - All references removed from dashboard

### What Remains:

- ✅ **"My Revenue Overview"** - Main commission balance card
- ✅ **Commission breakdown** - Superadmin deposits and receipt approvals
- ✅ **Important note** - Commission balance information
- ✅ **All functionality** - Real-time updates, balance tracking, etc.

## Technical Details

### Files Modified:

1. `src/app/dashboard/commission/page.tsx` - Removed Transaction History section and import

### Build Status:

- ✅ **Successful build** - no TypeScript errors
- ✅ **No lint issues** - all unused imports removed
- ✅ **Reduced bundle size** - Commission dashboard now 2.22 kB (down from 2.24 kB)

### Code Quality:

- ✅ **Clean code** - No unused imports or components
- ✅ **Maintained structure** - Other sections remain unchanged
- ✅ **Mobile responsive** - All remaining sections still mobile-optimized

## Final Result

The commission dashboard now shows only:

1. **My Revenue Overview Card**:

   - My Merchant Deposits: $0.00
   - From deposits and receipt approvals only
   - Breakdown by source (Superadmin Deposits / Receipt Approvals)

2. **Important Note Section**:
   - Commission balance information
   - Explanation of earning sources

The Transaction History section with the list of individual transactions has been completely removed as requested.
