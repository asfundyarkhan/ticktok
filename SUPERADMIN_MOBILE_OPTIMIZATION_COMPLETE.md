<div className="hidden lg:block">
  <table>...</table>
</div>

// Mobile cards (hidden on desktop)
<div className="lg:hidden space-y-4">
  {items.map(item => (
    <div className="bg-white border rounded-lg p-4">...</div>
  ))}
</div>
```

### Mobile-First Responsive Classes

```tsx
// Headers and navigation
className = "text-xl sm:text-2xl";
className = "flex flex-col sm:flex-row sm:items-center";

// Buttons and inputs
className = "w-full sm:w-auto";
className = "text-sm sm:text-base";

// Padding and spacing
className = "p-4 sm:p-6";
className = "mb-4 sm:mb-6";
```

### Mobile Card Structure

```tsx
// Organized sections with clear headers
<div className="border-t border-gray-100 pt-3">
  <p className="text-xs font-medium text-gray-500 uppercase">SECTION TITLE</p>
  // Section content
</div>
```

### Enhanced Modal Design

```tsx
// Mobile-first modal sizing and positioning
<div className="inline-block w-full max-w-md transform overflow-hidden rounded-lg bg-white text-left align-bottom shadow-xl transition-all sm:my-8 sm:max-w-lg sm:align-middle">
  // Mobile-optimized content
