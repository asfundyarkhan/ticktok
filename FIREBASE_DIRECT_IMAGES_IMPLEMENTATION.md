# Firebase Image Direct Loading Implementation

## Overview

This document details the implementation of a stricter image loading policy for the orders/pending page that ensures only real Firebase Storage images are displayed without any fallback mechanisms.

## Changes Made

1. **Removed Placeholder Fallbacks**
   - Removed the placeholder image fallback mechanism that previously showed default images when the real Firebase Storage image failed to load
   - Updated the `getBestProductImage` and `getFirestoreImage` helper functions to return empty strings instead of placeholders
   - Removed error handling that redirected to placeholders

2. **Improved Firebase URL Formatting**
   - Enhanced the URL formatting logic to ensure proper Firebase Storage URLs
   - Added additional validation to filter out empty image paths
   - Added more detailed logging to track image URL formatting

3. **Updated Image Arrays**
   - Changed `images: productImage ? [productImage] : []` to `images: productImage ? [productImage] : undefined`
   - This prevents empty arrays from being created when no image is available

## Technical Implementation

### Image Helper Updates

The `getBestProductImage` function now:
- Returns an empty string instead of a placeholder when no image is found
- Includes support for the `productImage` property which is specific to the orders page
- Properly validates all image sources before returning

The `getFirestoreImage` function now:
- Returns an empty source object `{src: "", unoptimized: false}` when no image is available
- No longer falls back to placeholders

### Image Component Updates

Image components in both desktop and mobile views now:
- Log errors when images fail to load but don't replace with placeholders
- Use the Firebase-specific optimization settings

### Data Mapping Updates

The data mapping logic now:
- Sets empty strings for invalid image paths
- Only creates image arrays when valid images exist
- Adds improved logging for image URL processing

## Outcome

With these changes, the orders page will now:
1. Only display real images from Firebase Storage
2. Show empty spaces when images are not available or fail to load
3. Never use placeholder images
4. Have improved logging to help track image loading issues

This implementation ensures that users see only authentic product images from the backend data source without any fallback mechanisms that might hide issues with the real images.
